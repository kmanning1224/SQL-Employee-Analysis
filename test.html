  <title>Gettin' Comfy with SQL</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This Project was all about SQL and learning to use it efficiently and effectively.
</h1>
<ul>
    <li>This assignment focussed on creating tables and querying them.</li>
    <li>I was able to make an ERD to explain the connection of my tables.</li>
    <li>After going through and querying through my questions I created some plots to explain them.</li>

</ul>

<h5>I made a histogram to outline the most common salaries amongst the employees.</h5>

<h5>Then I went through and made a barchart of the average salary based off employment type.</h5>

<h5>In summary, I followed through the instructions and found out the data set was actually fake.</h5>
